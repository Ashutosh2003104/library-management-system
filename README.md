### Description of the Library Management System GUI

The Library Management System is a graphical user interface (GUI) application developed using Python's `Tkinter` library. This system is designed to streamline the process of managing library operations, such as tracking borrowed books, managing member information, and displaying transaction details. Below is a detailed description of the system's components and features.

- It is designed with intuitive navigation for ease of use by both library staff and administrators.

#### 2. **Member Information Panel:**
- Provides fields to input details such as:
  - **Member Type:** Dropdown with options like Admin Staff, Student, and Lecturer.
  - **PRN Number and ID Number:** Unique identifiers for members.
  - **First Name, Last Name, Address, and Contact Info:** Personal details of members.

#### 3. **Book Details Panel:**

  - **Days on Loan:** Displays the number of days for which a book is borrowed.
  - **Late Return Fine:** Captures fine amounts for overdue books.

#### 4. **Display Panel:**

  - Includes columns for all key details (e.g., Member Type, Book Title, PRN Number).
  - Equipped with vertical and horizontal scrollbars for easy navigation.

#### 5. **Books List:**
- A `Listbox` widget that displays a predefined list of books.
- Users can select a book from the list to autofill the book details fields.

#### 6. **Control Buttons:**
- **Add Data:** Saves a new record to the database or display.
- **Show Data:** Displays all records in the `Treeview`.

### Missing/Planned Functionality

#### Database Integration:
- While the GUI design is complete, the application currently lacks backend database connectivity.
- Suggested backend: MySQL for storing and retrieving library data.

#### Input Validation:
- Add logic to validate fields for:
  - Non-empty values.
  - Correct data formats (e.g., numeric values for fines).

#### Event Handlers:
- Link `Listbox` and `Treeview` selections to auto-populate fields for viewing or editing.

### Future Enhancements

1. **Authentication System:**
   - Add a login feature to restrict access to authorized personnel.

2. **Automated Fine Calculation:**
   - Implement a dynamic system to compute fines based on overdue days.

3. **Search Functionality:**

By implementing these features and enhancing the application, the Library Management System can become a robust tool for effectively managing library operations.
